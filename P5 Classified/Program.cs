/*
It's up to you to design classes and their inheritance.

Create a Project named P5Classified
Your Game has the following classes:

Bread, Banana, Apple, Pear
Sword, Axe, Pencil, Shield, Spear
Tree, Gorilla, Chimpanzee, Sparrow, Pigeon, Hawk
Design the classes by thinking about:

Can they be held in your hands?
Is it an object intended to be used in Combat?
Do they live?
Are they known to have many Vitamins?
Can they be eaten?
Hint: You need to add some additional classes. e.g.:

If the given classes were Red, Blue, Green
You might wanna add an additional class named Color
Hint: Go a bit overboard! Every time you find two or more classes that have many traits in common, give them a common parent class, e.g.:

If the given classes were Tulip, Dandelion, Oak, Fir
You could add Flower as a parent for Tulip and Dandelion
You could add Tree for Oak and Fir
and Plant for Tree and Flower

Bonus 1: Draw the Hierarchy as an Image using a Drawing Application or Miro

Bonus 2: Use Mermaid to create a Mermaid Diagram for the Class Hierarchy and put it in your Repository's README.md
